# Healthcare_project
Explored 100,000+ patient healthcare data set, assessing key factors such as hospital equality &amp; duration of hospital stay. 

## Highlights

In this project I learnt:

✔️Importing the dataset

✔️Modifying and changing columns (difference between them is I can't rename the column using MODIFY COLUMN, but I can do it with CHANGE COLUMN)

✔️ The order of the execution of the queries.

✔️ WHERE and HAVING BY (difference is that WHERE is for filtering columns prior to any aggregations done on them, once aggregations such as SUM() or MIN() or AVG() etc. have been performed, then HAVING BY is the option)

✔️INNER JOIN 

✔️UNION

✔️CTEs

✔️ Creating tables, creating Temporary Tables and Dropping the tables.

✔️Concatenation of the data using CONCAT() fundtion.

## Order of Execution of query
